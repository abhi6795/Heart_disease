Classification model to predict the heart disease


The following dataset is a sample that contains patients’ information (demographics and medical data) that relates to heart disease prediction. The features are:¶

Age: age of the patient [years]

Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]

ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

T_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]

HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]

As a data analyst, you are tasked to answer the following questions to obtain insights about the data and to conduct predictive modeling to forecast the presence of heart failure (variable HeartDisease).
